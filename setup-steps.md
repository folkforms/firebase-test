# Setup steps

- Create a folder and `cd` into it
- `git init`
- `create-react-app 
- `npm init` (not sure if this is necessary or create-react-app does it for you)
- `firebase init`
    - Choose all the things esp. hosting. For your "What do you want to use as your public directory?" enter "build"
    - If you have not set up firebase this will send you to the firebase website and you need to register your project and then do it all over again
- `firebase deploy --only hosting` to deploy
